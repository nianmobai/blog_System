<font color='gree'>this is a project that a learner learn how to make a blog system.</font>

<br>

>notice:Because this project is making.So you can use it as a learning  module or tool.But if you want to use it as a real blog system, there are still many shortages and the capabilities to be implemented.So as far as I'm concerned,I strongly do suggest that you deploy it on your web server,and then its front side is still making,back end is just in my mind,I have no timg to realize it.So this project is just suggested as a reference to learn.   

For the document I take some time to make it.maybe a long time?I think it can be 3 month.
In this document I am talking about the blog and how to use it.
## Firstly you need a php environment
here is the link of php download
<a href='https://www.php.net'>php</a>

## Secondly you need a web server 
if you want your blog can be finded by other by using internet,you must have a web server.The server we need doesn't need such high configuration, but it must be connected with the internet and have the everything a web serve needs.
the web server
<a href='https://apache.org'>Apache</a>
or
<a href='https://nginx.org/en/'>Nignx</a> 
is ok.

I am not good at web server Configuration,so I don't have the ablity to teach you to deploy the web server.You can read the essays about how to deploy web serve wrote by other people.In this document I just want to tell you what you need in this project.
## Thirdly MySQL is needed
In my project, I use Mysql to manage the data of your blog essays and other data.So,you need to download MySQL or other SQL softwares that support SQL lanuage.Standard SQL lanuage is used here.

that's all the preparation you need to make.
For the framework used:
